This living document will be updated regularly with new information and examples to help you make the most of the HLDK system.\n\nNOTE that the guide is a work in progress and is not complete yet....\n\nWhat is this?\nA node based server and web UI that allows you to develop at a higher level (in English) by offloading the actual coding to an LLM-powered Software Engineering Agent.\n\nCurrently we support Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.5\nGetting Started\nSet your Anthropic API Key in the server .env file\nIf you don't already have an API account with Anthropic then sign up at https://console.anthropic.com\n\nThen go to settings (top right) --> Api Keys --> Create Key\nThen create a .env file in the root of this repo and add your key with something like:\necho \"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-anthropic-api-key>\" > .env\nA note about Anthropic credits and paying for Claude\nYou will need to add a debit or credit card and purchase some credits. A developer working flat out most days is going to rack up something like £100 worth of tokens per month. YMMV based on repo size etc. You can set limits in the Anthropic Console to protect yourself. I suggest you have your own Anthropic account and either expense it or use a company debit/credit card. If you try to share an API key among developers then you may well run into per month usage limits or rate limits.\n\nInstall Required Tools\nTo run the Higher Level Dev Kit, you need to have Node.js (version 21 or higher) and pnpm installed on your system. If you don't have these tools installed, follow these steps:\n\nInstall Node.js:\n\nVisit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/\nDownload and install the latest LTS version (21.x or higher)\nInstall pnpm:\n\nAfter installing Node.js, open a terminal or command prompt\nRun the following command to install pnpm globally:\nnpm install -g pnpm\nFor more information on installing and using pnpm, visit: https://pnpm.io/installation\n\nOnce you have Node.js and pnpm installed, you can proceed with the setup of the Higher Level Dev Kit.\n\nAudio Transcription Setup\nThe Higher Level Dev Kit includes support for audio transcription (talk into the mic instead of typing) using the faster-whisper library. To set up the audio transcription feature, follow these steps:\n\nMake sure you have Python3 and pip installed on your system. If not, the installation script will attempt to install them for you.\n\nRun the install-faster-whisper.sh script:\n\n./scripts/install-faster-whisper.sh\nThis script will:\n\nCheck if Python3 and pip are installed, and install them if necessary.\nInstall the faster-whisper-cli package using pip.\nAfter running the script, the faster-whisper-cli should be installed and ready to use with the Higher Level Dev Kit.\n\nNote: The installation script supports macOS and Linux. For Windows users, you may need to install Python3, pip, and faster-whisper-cli manually.\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the installation, please refer to the error messages in the console or seek assistance from the project maintainers.\n\nRunning the HLDK Server\nOnce you have completed the setup steps above, you can start the HLDK server using the provided script. Follow these steps:\n\nOpen a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the HLDK project.\n\nRun the following command:\n\n./hldk.sh\nThis script will:\n\nInstall or update npm packages using pnpm\nStart the HLDK server\nWait for the server to start. You should see a message indicating that the server is running.\n\nOnce the server is running, you can access the web UI by opening a web browser and navigating to: http://localhost:3010\n\nIf you encounter any issues while starting the server, check the console output for error messages. Make sure you have completed all the setup steps, including setting your Anthropic API key in the .env file and installing the required tools.\n\nTo stop the server, you can use Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running.\n\nWorkspaces\nHigher Level Dev Kit\n\nImport a Local Repo\nBefore you can start developing in tandem with the SE Agent you will need to configure a workspace. To do this select Workspaces from the left hand menu and then Import Local Repo where you will be asked for the full path to the git repo. It will take the dir name to be the name of the workspace unless you choose to override by providing a specific name for your repo.\n\nDefault Workspace\nThe first Workspace that you set up will be your default workspace and will appear at the top of the drop down on the SE Agent page. If you want to select a different workspace as your default then you can do that from the Workspaces page by selecting the workspace in the table and hitting Set as Default\n\nBuild/Test Command\nYou can set a command or script for the SE Agent to run after it makes its code changes but before committing them to git. Just hit Edit with the workspace selected and enter the command. Note that the Agent may not always run the command automatically and if it doesn't then a simple \"test\" prompt should suffice. The Agent should iterate and keep trying to fix stuff until the tests pass.\n\nSoftware Engineering Agent\nHigher Level Dev Kit\n\nSessions\nCreate a new session for each new mini-spec that you want to send to the agent. If you try to do too much on one session then the agent may get confused. Also be sure to select the correct Workspace or the agent will definitely get confused!\n\nIf you want to make tweaks to the code that was just generated then that is usually fine to do in the same session.\n\nChatting with the agent\nSend specs or commands by filling out the text area at the bottom that says \"Type your message\" and then clicking the Send or simply hitting Enter.\n\nIf you want a new line you can use Shift+Enter\n\nThe agent can see all the files in the git repo but it may need hints as to where to look for things.\n\nYou can say things like:\n\n\"Update the session page in the web ui to do x, y, z...\"\n\"Look at mutation service and repo and make changes to do x,y,z...\"\n\"Use the person module as an example and implement a new module called Foo with props (x,y,z) - implement the repo, service, controller with unit tests for all\"\nVoice Transcription\nHigher Level Dev Kit\n\nIf you want to provide your specs via voice then make sure you have installed the faster whisper cli (see above) and then just HOLD the mic button down... once the mic button turns red then it is listening and will continue to listen until you let go of the button at which point the recording is streamed to the server and then to faster whisper and the resulting text will appear in the text area. You will then still need to submit this text by pressing Enter or clicking the send button.\n\nAborting\nIf the agent seems to be going awry then you can interrupt what it is doing by hitting the red stop button.\n\nUpdates\nDuring the process of making code updates the SE Agent will update some source files by using its Search & Replace file update tool. Each operation with this tool results in an entry to the Updates panel on the right. You may see multiple updates for a single file and that is normal because in large files the agent will not want to have to update the whole file at once (lots of expensive output tokens) and so it uses multiple Search & Replace edits (find the search text in the file and replace it with the replace text) to more efficiently update multiple bits.\n\nIn the Update panel you have the choice of viewing the Description which shows the Search & Replace block that the agent has generated to make the edit or either the Before or After panels which show the full file contents immediately before or after the edit. You can double-click on the Before or After text to copy the file contents to the clipboard in case that's useful.\n\nGit Log\nHigher Level Dev Kit\n\nAs an alternative to the Updates panel you can switch to see the Git Log which shows the last 10 or so commits.\n\nYou can choose to revert the last commit by clicking on the little red revert icon.\n\nOr you can choose to open a new browser tab to see the unified Git diff for the commit by clicking on the blue git icon.\n\nHigher Level Dev Kit\n\nSessions Page\nHigher Level Dev Kit\n\nIf you need to go back to a previous session then you should be able to find it on the recent sessions page along with some stats about each session. You can click on the link to take you back to the SE Agent with that session loaded.\n\nPlease note that you may not be able to continue with the session if the server has been restarted recently. This is because the Snapshotting of session data (for Langgraph) is currently only persisted to RAM and not disk.\n\nUse a Hints file\nThe SE Agent will always look for a file called hints.md in the root of the git repo and the contents are passed on to Claude. You should add one to your repo and let the agent know about any helpful hints for adding code to the repo.\n\nIt should contain things like:\n\nHow you want your code laid out (if it's not already obvious from the existing code)\nMaybe what package manager you are using (if it's not obvious from the file tree)\nPoint to good examples of things (e.g. services, entities etc) to look at when adding a new one of those\nTips about architecture or performance stuff\nHere is an example from the HigherLevelDevKit itself:\n\n   # These are hints for HLDK or any other AI agent to help it understand the codebase.\n   \n   # DATABASE CHANGES\n   \n   When making changes to the database schema you need to add a new Flyway migration script to the `/migrations` directory.\n   \n   Remember:\n   - Use pnpm for all package management calls and NOT npm or yarn.\n   - IMPORTANT: Never run pnpm in the root directory\n   - For server packages changes you will need to run 'cd hldk-server && pnpm add '\n   - For client packages changes you will need to run 'cd vitify-webui && pnpm add '\n   - For ID generation always use ulid - we have already added the ulid package to the project.\n   - When generating db related code always try to minimise the number of db round trips - so use group by and in clauses where possible etc.\nAbout\nHigher Level Dev Kit - Command your own set of AI Coding Agents\n\nResources\n Readme\nLicense\n View license\n Activity\n Custom properties\nStars\n 1 star\nWatchers\n 7 watching\nForks\n 0 forks\nReleases 22\nv0.8.0\nLatest\n2 days ago\n+ 21 releases\nPackages\nNo packages published\nPublish your first package\nLanguages\nShell\n36.9%\n \nHTML\n35.2%\n \nBatchfile\n27.9%\nFooter\n© 2024 GitHub, Inc.\nFooter navigation\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact\nManage cookies\nDo not share my personal information\nHigherLevelDev/hldk: Higher Level Dev Kit - Command your own set of AI Coding Agents",
