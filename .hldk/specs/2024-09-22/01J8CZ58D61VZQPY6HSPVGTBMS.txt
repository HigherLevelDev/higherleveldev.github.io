This is currently a blank jekyll scaffolded repo but I want you to customise it. Update the default config etc This should be the website for HigherLevel.dev domain and will host the Higher Level Dev Guide which is documenting how to direct AI software engineering agents to build software much more rapidly. We want to deploy this to github pages so make the necessary changes for that too.
